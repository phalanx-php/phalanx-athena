/**
 * Adapts a coroutine-readable {@see HttpStream} into the SSE event
 * stream Athena providers consume.
 *
 * The adapter owns the byte loop: it pulls bytes from the HttpStream
 * via `read()`, feeds them into a fresh {@see SseParser}, and yields
 * each parsed event as `{event: ?string, data: string}`. EOF on the
 * upstream HttpStream terminates the iteration.
 *
 * Lifecycle: the caller owns the HttpStream; it must close the stream
 * after the iterator finishes (typically via try/finally inside the
 * provider's __invoke). HttpSseSource does not close the stream itself
 * because providers may want to inspect status/headers post-iteration.
