 * Coroutine-aware Guzzle handler stack factory.
 *
 * Many third-party SDKs (AWS, Stripe, official OpenAI/Anthropic SDKs) ship
 * with Guzzle as their HTTP client. Guzzle's default cURL handler blocks
 * the OpenSwoole reactor; the {@see \Hyperf\Guzzle\CoroutineHandler} adapter
 * swaps it for a coroutine-native client backed by `OpenSwoole\Coroutine\Http\Client`.
 *
 * This helper returns a configured `\GuzzleHttp\HandlerStack` so callers can
 * pass it to any Guzzle-using SDK:
 *
 * ```php
 * $client = new \GuzzleHttp\Client(['handler' => CoroutineGuzzleStack::create()]);
 * ```
 *
 * Both `guzzlehttp/guzzle` and `hyperf/guzzle` are opt-in via composer suggest.
 * Calling this without either installed raises a clear {@see RuntimeException}
 * naming the missing dependency.
